          Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          - PR Head SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          - PR Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}

           Objectives:
           1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed
           2) Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues
           3) Leave very short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on changed lines only and a brief summary at the end

           Procedure:
           - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
           - Get diff: gh pr diff
           - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ✅ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes
           - Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines

           Commenting rules:
           - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues
           - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
           - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
           - Use emojis: 🚨 Critical 🔒 Security ⚡ Performance ⚠️ Logic ✅ Resolved ✨ Improvement

           Submission:
           - Submit one review containing inline comments plus a concise summary
           - Use only: gh pr review --comment
           - Do not use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes
