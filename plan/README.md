# Plan Directory

This directory contains short-term planning documents, execution plans, and feature-specific planning materials.

**Note**: This directory is gitignored by default. Only this README is tracked in version control.

## Purpose

Short-term documents that are useful during active development but become outdated quickly:
- Phase execution plans
- Migration checklists
- Implementation timelines
- Work-in-progress planning documents

## Long-term Documentation

For permanent reference documentation, see the `docs/` directory instead:
- Architecture designs
- Operational guides
- API references
- System documentation
